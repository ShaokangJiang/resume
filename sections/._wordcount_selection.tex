	\entry{Worked with Michael Coblenz on the usability analysis of autocomplete.}
	\entry{Designed and executed an experiment with 32 participants using an eye tracker to evaluate the costs and benefits of IDE-based autocomplete features to programmers who use an unfamiliar API; analyzed data using JMP; and wrote a paper for the study.}
	\entry{Found that participants who used autocomplete learned more about the API while spending less time reading the documentation; found autocomplete did not significantly reduce the number of keystrokes required to finish tasks.}
	% \entry{Found the primary benefit of autocomplete is in providing information, not in reducing time spent typing.}
	\entry{Acquired fundamental skills in conducting empirical research studies and learned various methods for handling and understanding the implications of eye-tracking data.}
	% \entry{Successfully designed an experiment with well-formed hypotheses and a comprehensive knowledge test suite to accurately capture the benefits and costs of autocomplete. Additionally, designed procedures and produced scripts to analyze data from various sources, including a substantial amount of data from a consumer-level eye tracker.}
