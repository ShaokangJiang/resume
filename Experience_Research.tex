        \resumeItem{Worked with Michael Coblenz on the usability analysis of Copilot.}
        \resumeItem{Designed an experiment using an eye tracker to evaluate the costs and benefits of Copilot for programmers new to React. Piloted it with 5 programmers, incorporating iterative improvements. The full study is underway.}
        \resumeItem{Designed and implemented a more universal eye-tracking platform for native VSCode to collect user interaction data and developed a VSCode extension to assist with the experiment.}

        \resumeItem{Worked with Jude Abishek Rayan under the guidance of Steven Dow on improving workshop communication protocols for projects CueHub and workshop management.}
        \resumeItem{For the CueHub project, I built, redesigned and tested a customized online meeting platform with automatic cue support and integrated monitoring tools based on the discussion results. Utilized GPTs to provide cues during meetings to improve communication. Wrote design decisions and implementation sections in the paper, and assisted in designing, engaging in discussions throughout the entire research workflow, and data analysis.}
        \resumeItem{For workshop management project, I designed and developed a 4-component workshop management system for real-time user engagement using prompt-engineered GPTs to foster better and more diversified idea generation via cues and discussed ways to improve communication for all groups during meetings.}

      \resumeItemListStart
        \resumeItem{Worked with Michael Coblenz on the usability analysis of autocomplete.}
        \resumeItem{Designed and executed an experiment with 32 participants using an eye tracker to evaluate the costs and benefits of IDE-based autocomplete features for programmers using an unfamiliar API, analyzed data using JMP, performed thementic analysis, and published a paper on the Foundations of Software Engineering.}
        \resumeItem{Found that participants who used autocomplete learned more while spending less time reading documentation, although autocomplete did not significantly reduce the number of keystrokes required to complete tasks.}
        \resumeItem{Designed and implemented an eye-tracking platform for web-based VSCode, a Chrome extension, and a VSCode extension to collect data. Developed several scripts and algorithms for automatic and semi-automatic data analysis.}

        \resumeItem{Investigated whether Python Type Hints are helpful for competitive programmers.}
        \resumeItem{Designed and executed an experiment, containing tasks and interview, with 4 participants.}
        \resumeItem{Found that Python type hints were not significantly more useful for competitive programmers in terms of task completion time and debugging time.}
        \resumeItem{Thematic analysis of interview results and transcripts indicated programmers feel adding type hints and the popped out autocomplete suggestions to be annoying.}
